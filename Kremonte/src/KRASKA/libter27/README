         See the Copyrights section below for more information.

Disclaimer:  This is preliminary work, the author takes no
responsibility for errors in this work but would appreciate being
informed of such errors.  If you suggest a repair to the author
your repair may be incorporated into future releases of this
material with attribution under the applicable license.

Acknowledgement:  This work was partially supported by Jinn Labs
with the understanding that the results will be made available
under a license at least as permissive as the Gnu Public License.

Installation:  This distribution includes a Makefile.  On Unix,
Linux and MacOS systems, after unbundling this code into its
own directory, you should be able to run the following tests
immediately:
  make test9
  make test27
  make test9io
  make test27io
  make test927
These tests should each output some progress report and then end
with a notice saying success.  Read the Makefile for additional
things you can make.

Tutorial note:  See the source code for the test files for many
examples that use the routines in libternary; see the sections of
the Makefile that run these tests for the shell commands required
to compile and link code that uses libternary.

Copyrights:  Each file in this distribution is marked with one of
the following copyright notices:

  Creative Commons CC0 1.0 Universal License
  See https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/
     This notice applies to test and demonstration files that are
     distributed with the intent that programmers are free to
     borrow and adapt that code without need to cite or attribute
     the source, obtain permission, or otherwise bother the author.
     Acknowledgement and thanks for the use of these files are
     welcome, but not required.

     This notice applies to the key intellectual content of this
     distribution, code that implements binary-coded ternary
     arithmetic operations.  This licence requires acknowledgement
     in any redistribution, but it allows derivitive works to be
     subject to more restrictive licenses.

     Thus, material based on this code could be released under
     a strict all-rights-reserved copyright so long as the
     attribution required by the license is included.  Example:
     if someone modifies this code to support base 5 arithmetic,
     they are free to turn that into a proprietary product.

     Similarly, material based on this code could be released
     under the Gnu Public License (GPL), a more restrictive
     license in that it includes general clauses requiring that
     all derivitives of that work be licensed under the GPL.
     Example:  If someone modifies this code to support base 5
     arithmetic, they are free to release their version under the
     GPL.
